# BuzzWire_With_Text
This is the code for an advanced version of the game buzz wire. 

The first code is for a version that will output a clue and a piezo song upon completion. This was for a scavenger hunt. See https://www.instructables.com/id/Buzz-Wire-Scavenger-Hunt-Clue/ for more background on this project.

The second version of the code is for a game that will track the time it takes to complete the game and display a high score. See https://www.instructables.com/id/Buzzwire-Time-Trials/ for this project. 

Physical build is identical between the two versions.
